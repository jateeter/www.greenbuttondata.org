<p>Green Button is an industry-led effort that responds to a White House call-to-action: provide electricity customers with easy access to their energy usage data in a consumer-friendly and computer-friendly format via a "Green Button" on electric utilities' website. Green Button is based on a common technical standard adopted voluntarily by utilities that allows software developers and other entrepreneurs to create applications and tools to help consumers make the most of their energy usage information.</p>
<p>
By putting customers in control of their own energy data, they can choose which tools and services can help them manage their energy performance.</p>

<p>Companies are already developing applications using Green Button data to help people choose the best rate plan for their use patterns; deliver customized energy-efficiency tips; offer easy-to-use tools to size and finance rooftop solar panels; and conduct virtual energy audits that can cut costs for building owners and speed the initiation of retrofits. </p>
 
Creating new ways to help consumers understand and manage their energy use and the environmental impact of that usage is a field ripe for American innovation.</p>
